The inspiration for the Restaurant Web App came from a personal experience and a desire to solve a real world problem that affects many small and medium-sized restaurants. 
Few months back I visited a family-owned restaurant in my neighborhood that had some of the best food I had ever tested. Despite their excellent cuisine, the restaurant was struggling to attract more customers. When I spoke with the owner,  I discovered that their primary challenge was limited visibility and the inability to offer convenient online ordering options, which many customers now expect.
This encounter planted the seed for the restaurant Web App project. I envisioned creating a platform that would help the restaurant Enhance online presence, Simplify ordering and improve customer engagement.
